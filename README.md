# Movie Recommendation System üçøüé¨

In the age of digital entertainment, finding the perfect movie to watch can be a daunting task given the vast array of options available. A Movie Recommendation System aims to simplify this process by leveraging data to suggest movies that align with the user's preferences. This project focuses on building a recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions based on various attributes such as genres, ratings, and other metadata.

The main objective of this project is to develop a system that **analyzes a movie dataset to find films similar to a given movie**. This system leverages **cosine similarity, a metric that measures how similar movies are based on their attributes, to deliver accurate recommendations**.

The dataset was derived from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/code/thedevastator/imdb-5000-movies-multiple-genres-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakkesharv/imdb-5000-movies-multiple-genres-dataset). It displays different about each movie like director, actors, genres etc. The raw dataset contains ten columns with a mix of categorical and quantitative values, offering a comprehensive view of each movie‚Äôs attributes.
